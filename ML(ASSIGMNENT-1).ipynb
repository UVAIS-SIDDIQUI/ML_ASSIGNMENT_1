    "ans a) Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and mimic human actions. AI encompasses a wide range of technologies and applications, from simple rule-based systems to advanced neural networks. One example of AI is virtual assistants like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, or Google Assistant. These assistants use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries, making them seem more human-like in their interactions.\n",

    "b) Machine Learning:\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed. A classic example of machine learning is email spam filtering. Instead of manually programming rules to identify spam emails, machine learning algorithms can be trained on a dataset of labeled emails (spam or non-spam) to automatically learn patterns and characteristics of spam emails. Once trained, the algorithm can accurately classify new incoming emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that deals with artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning algorithms, called neural networks, consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data and extract features at increasing levels of abstraction. A popular example of deep learning is image recognition. Deep neural networks can be trained on a large dataset of labeled images to recognize objects, faces, or patterns within images with remarkable accuracy. For instance, deep learning models power facial recognition systems used in social media platforms, security systems, and even healthcare for medical image analysis."
